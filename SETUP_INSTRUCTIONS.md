# 🚀 Mappia Food Delivery App - Setup Instructions

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

1. **✅ Security Fixed** - Moved Supabase credentials to constants
2. **✅ File Structure Created** - Organized project with proper architecture
3. **✅ Core Models Built** - User, Product, Order models ready
4. **✅ Database Schema Ready** - Complete SQL schema for Supabase
5. **✅ Authentication Service** - Login/Register functionality

## 🔥 Next Steps (In Order of Priority)

### 1. **Set Up Database (URGENT)**
```bash
# Go to your Supabase dashboard
# Navigate to SQL Editor

# Run the SQL script
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. **Test the App**
```bash
flutter run
```

### 4. **Create Database Tables**
After running the SQL script, you should have these tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles
- `restaurants` - Restaurant information
- `categories` - Food categories
- `products` - Food items
- `orders` - Customer orders
- `cart` - Shopping cart
- `addresses` - Delivery addresses
- `reviews` - Customer reviews

```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (For Production)

Create a `.env` file (not tracked by git):
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
